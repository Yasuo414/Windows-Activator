# Windows-Activator
is an easy tool to activate Windows

# Support
the tool ONLY supports WINDOWS 11 at this time,
but future updates will support older Windows as well

# How to use
You know the .zip files and the .exe in them.
If you do, it's a piece of cake for you. 
But if you don't know the .zip files,
it doesn't matter as here are the steps to use the tool.

Steps:
1) Download the latest .zip file from Releases
2) Drag it to any location on your computer
3) RIGHT click on the file and put "Extract All"
4) Open the unzipped folder
5) Locate Windows Activator.exe
6) RIGHT CLICK on the file and put "Run as Administrator", this is to make the program able to use the commands assigned to it
7) Put "Yes" in the popup window and let the program work
8) When it's done, say "Done!"
9) Done! You are good. You've done it.
